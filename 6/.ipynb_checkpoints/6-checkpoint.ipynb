    "To determine if there is a relationship between this potential agent (nicotine) and the outcome (low birth weight) we can utilize Hill's criteria for evaluating evidence for causal associations.  First, there appears to be a strong association between the agent and outcome (PeR=.8).  Second, there appears to be a direct link between the agent and the outcome in that nicotine induces fetal hypoxia, which reduces fetal birth weight.  Third, the temporal sequence of events is maintained because the exposure to nicotine preceeds the development of low birth weight.  Fourth, the consistency across studies is difficult to get at in this case because a single study is presented (though a brief literature search yields similar findings).  Fifth, the dose-response relationship cannot be addressed with the data provided here because the study is only broken down into low and normal birthweights by +/- nicotine in blood (would be helpful if the levels of nicotine and the birth weights were provided), though a dose-response pattern has been noted in the literature.  Sixth, the biological plausibility calls back the second of Hill's criteria in that the affect of nicotine having a biological affect on birth weight is plausible given that nicotine leads to fetal hypoxia and reduces birth weight.  And finally, the experimental evidence here does suggest that nicotine exposure leads to an increased risk of low birth weight."
